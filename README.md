# Automated-Instagram-News-Post-Generation
*Note, this is an older older project and much of the code has been lost as it was developed on an older Macbook. It is being reconstructed from my documentation for GitHub showcase purposes! You can also find the page on Instagram at @DailyCapacity.*

## Basic Project Overview
Engineered a fully autonomous content pipeline using Cron jobs, APIs and NLP to scrape, summarize, and format global news into aesthetically (okay, aesthetic be a bit of a stretch) matched Instagram posts every hour. At its peak the page garnered 1000+ followers.
